# codsoft_internship_game
This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python and Tkinter. The user plays against the computer, and the game displays both choices and the result (win, lose, or draw). It also tracks the score during the session. Created as a part of the CodSoft Internship to demonstrate Python GUI development and basic game logic.
